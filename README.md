# General Knowledge Quiz

Users who like to challenge themselves on broad themes are the target audience for this website. Users can assess their level of knowledge about the world in general by answering a variety of questions that are related to seemingly random themes. It is a good way for them to learn something new and intriguing while also refreshing their memories.

## Design


### Colour Scheme

- The colour scheme was motivated by the intention to make sure the quiz delivers a fun and playful feel towards the user.
- The contrasts between the light and dark purple is used to display a consistent theme throughout every page. 
- While presenting a minimalistic and straightforward layout, the white background draws the user's attention to the Quiz box area.
- The heading and the question are black and bold, distinguishing it from the rest of the text to indicate they are headings of the text below.
- 

### Typography

- Using the Arvo font style throughout the game was intentional to ensure a modern feel was emphasised throughout the website.
- The Arvo font also allowed a clear read for the reader, whilst maintaing a minimilist feel.
